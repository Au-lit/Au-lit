# A `readme.md`, according to the Github base template.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Au-lit
- 👀 I’m interested in stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me: use stuff.

Ok this is useless.

# A C++ like `readme.md`
```cpp
[[nodiscard]] inline constexpr auto = au_lit{
  .name = u"Ollivier Roberge",
  .age = rand(),
  .location = u"カナダ",
  .learning = { /* stuff */ },
  .interests = { /* stuff */ }
  .contact_info = { /* stuff */ }
};
```
...this is also useless...
